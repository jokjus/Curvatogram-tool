# Curvatogram tool
 Creative ool for creating images made of curved lines. Written in javascript and [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/).

## Setup
 1. Copy files to some directory on your hard drive. 
 2. Launch a local server of your choice. (I'm using CodeKit or Visual Studio Code Live Server). 
    - Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/  
    - Visual Studio Code Live Server https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
    - CodeKit https://codekitapp.com/
 3. Open curvatogram.html in a browser.

## Usage
 It's pretty self explanatory, just click on the image blocks and toggle curve direction from the green buttons. Tune settings from the settings panel on the left. 
 Note: Changing grid size randomizes block orientations.

## Using custom images
 Just drag and drop jpg or png image onto right side of the browser screen. Please use a rectangular image. Suitable image size varies depending on your display. For a laptop 800x800 px is about right.

## Export SVG
 Exports an SVG image, open with Inkscape, Illustrator or other vector editing software of your choice.
